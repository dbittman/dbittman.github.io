excerpt: I discovered that gnuplot can create an HTML5 canvas, and I wanted to know how screwed California is.

<p>Maybe it's my obsession with pretty graphs and nice data, but I've always wanted to know one simple piece of
information: how much as it rained over the past x days? If x happens to be exactly 30 or however many days it's 
been since the start of the "rainy season", that's not particularly hard to get (though it requires a surprising
amount of googling). But if you just want to know how much rain fell during the most recent storm, you're pretty
much out of luck.</p>

<p>I'm continuing the tradition in my family of having a rain gauge and making little graphs of rainfall each month,
but I decided to go all high-tech on the idea and make a website to make these graphs automatically. Also that way
I don't have to go out in the rain to read the gauge every day.</p>

<h2>Enter Gnuplot</h2>

<p>Hey, Gnuplot can produce an HTML5 canvas element! How about I dynamically generate a webpage server-side by
shoving the output of Gnuplot into an HTML file and serving that up like a nice hot dinner? Hey, sounds great!<p>
