		<h2>BASIL</h2>
		<h3>Bass-Ackwards Stack ISA Language</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>BASIL is a stack based assembly language with a fixed-length instruction size and no registers. It supports
		basic byte based input and output, basic arithmetic and logical instructions, branching, and a <code>swap</code> instruction.
		The current version is <code>2.0.0</code>, and the full specification can be downloaded <a href="basil/basil-specification-2.0.0.pdf">here [PDF]</a>.</p>

		<p>BASIL is designed in collaboration with <a href="http://justinlardinois.com" target="_blank">Justin Lardinois</a>.</p>

		<h4>Instructions</h4>
		<p>Most instructions take no operands in the program code, but instead get them from the stack. For example, an <code>add</code> instruction pops two
		values off of the stack, adds them together, and pushes the result. Some other instructions take only one argument, for example <code>not</code>. It pops
		one value from the stack, does a bitwise not, and pushes the result.</p>

		<p>One instruction takes an argument: <code>push</code>. When the CPU encounters a <code>push</code> instruction, it interprets the next 4-bit instruction as
		a value to push onto the stack. Because it is only 4 bits, creating larger number requires clever use of multiple push instructions and arithmetic. This
		assembler extends the basic BASIL language by implementing automatic-value-generation. That is, it inserts instructions to generate large values in the place
		of instructions of the form <code>push n</code> where <code>n &gt; 15</code>. Note: using this feature will NOT generate portable code, since it is not in
		the core BASIL specification!</p>

		<p>One instruction of note is <code>swap</code>. It breaks the stack model by allowing elements to swap locations. It pops the top element, and uses it as
		an argument, n. If n is non-zero, it swaps the new top element of the stack with the nth element down. If n is zero, it pops the new top element from the stack
		and executes it. This non only allows self-modifying code, but also allows random access memory.<p>

		<h4>Implementation</h4>
		<p>This project contains an assembler and a BASIL machine simulator. The machine is a 32-bit word extension of the core BASIL specification to allow
		more advanced input and output, and more interesting CPU management.</p>

		<h4>Self-Hosting Virtual Machine</h4>
		<p>A secondary project that I am working on is a BASIL simulator that runs on the BASIL CPU. It reads in program code with get, and executes instructions. It
		uses swap0 to execute instructions, and also does specific processing of instructions that need more work (such as branching, swapping, etc).
		This is not complete.</p>
